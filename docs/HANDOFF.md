## Session TVB-0: Workspace Bootstrap (COMPLETE)

**Date:** 2026-06-27
**Status:** COMPLETE -- standalone workspace scaffolded, MCP wired, conventions mirrored.

### What was accomplished

- Created standalone git repo `C:\Strat_Trading_Bot\tradingview-backtesting` (branch `main`).
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` adapted for this domain: Pine-first vehicle, crypto-perp data rules (NOT
  the ATLAS equity/RTH orthodoxy), and the charter's epistemic stance encoded as binding rules.
- Moved the governing design doc out of vbt-workspace `Temporary/` to
  `docs/ATLAS_Timeframe_Continuity_Charter.md`.
- Wired the `tradingview` + `openmemory` MCP servers in `.mcp.json` (TRACKED here on purpose --
  no secrets -- so the wiring travels with the repo, fixing the vbt-workspace gitignore gotcha).
- `.claude/settings.json`: `ui_evaluate` denied (Tier 1), MCP servers enabled, and only the
  domain-agnostic global hooks kept (trading safety guard, ruff lint, test gate). The
  VBT/STRAT-Python guardians from vbt-workspace were intentionally NOT ported (Pine-first repo).
- Light `uv` Python project (`pyproject.toml`) for the analysis layer; smoke test added.
- Ported + adapted slash commands: `/session-start`, `/session-end`, `/pre-commit`.
- Seeded `.session_startup_prompt.md` with the TVB-1 plan.

### Context for next session

- Nothing strategic is built yet -- only the scaffold. The first real task (TVB-1) is to design
  and write the **baseline strategy()** WITH the user (charter Sections 3-4). This touches STRAT
  detection logic, so it is a strat-methodology STOP-and-ASK zone -- design before coding.
- The TradingView MCP install/gotchas are documented in the master guide at
  `vectorbt-workspace/docs/guides/TRADINGVIEW_MCP_INSTALL.md`; this workspace's
  `docs/guides/TRADINGVIEW_MCP_SETUP.md` is the local pointer + delta.

### Files created

Scaffold only -- see `git log` for the bootstrap commit. No strategy or analysis logic yet.
